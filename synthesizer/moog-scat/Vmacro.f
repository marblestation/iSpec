      real*8 function vmacro (xprofile)
c******************************************************************************
c     This routine computes, by linear interpolation, a point along a 
c     radial-tangential macroturbulence profile.  This routine was written by 
c     Suchitra Balachandran, and is based on the work of Gray 1992, in
c     "The Obs. & Anal. of Stell. Phot", p. 409.  These functions have 
c     been computed and included in the data arrays below:  
c             xrt = velocity / zeta_RT 
c             yrt = value at xrt  
c     The area under the function is normalized to unity
