# This file controls which species are treated in LTE/NLTE
# It also gives the path to the model atom and the departure files
# First created 2021-02-22
# if a species is absent it is assumed to be LTE
#
# each line contains :
# atomic number / name / (n)lte / model atom / departure file / binary or ascii departure file
#
# path for model atom files     ! don't change this line !
