Starts------17/01-2005

Implementation on Mac G5. Small changes to
ensure compilation on IBM xlf fortran

Added keywords:

PURE_LTE (true or false) for babsma. PURE_LTE=.t.
sets sigma=0. and adds up all continuous opacity 
into kappa.

SCATTFRAC (0.0 to 1.0) for bsyn. This splits
the line opacity into kappa*(1.-scattfrac)
and sigma*scattfrac

added the option to read the ascii marcs models
of the new uppsala grid. This is done with 
MARCS=.true. and an automatic detection of 
the binary/ascii format of the file.

BPz--------17/01-2005
Update eqwidt and bsyn

B. Plez 08/02-2005

implemented ionized lines collisional broadening
following Barkleem. Replace old anstee.f with new one
and old anstee data table with new one.

Reminder:
For those of you interested I have a working version
on Powermac G5 with xlf fortran compiler from IBM.

End of update

BPz--------08/09-2005

set all paths of data files in source files as
DATA/name_of_file. This requires that all users
copy the content of DATA in the directory from 
which they run babsma/bsyn/eqwidt. This is best
done through :
ln -s /Volumes/RAID1/home/plez/SPECTRUM/DATA .
It is also easier to port the code to another
machine. After copying the content of the DATA/
directory on the other machine, the code should
compile and run without the need to edit
the source code for file paths.

BPz--------08/09-2005

Now all paths are relative to local directory from which
program are run. User must link the DATA directory
(or copy it and its content) on his own directory.
This ensures easy port and recompilation/running on another
machine, without changing path to input data files.

BPz--------30/08-2006

changes between now and previous log in Readme ahve been
made. I am not sure what exactly. I think a bug was corrected to allow
reading spherical and plane-prallel ascii MARCS models.
Some small changes also to improve the convergence of the molecula equilibrium.

BPz--------05/12-2006

I have corrected a slight bug in injon.f, so that the original composition
of a binary MARCS model is printed out, for information only, and only
for the 20 elements. It is replaced by the default composition of 
makeabund.f anyway (or by the chemical composition input by the user).
I found this while trying to compute opacity files for Hydrogen deficient 
binary MARCS files. I got an error message as injon.f was trying to read
the file 1167867904 instead of file 11. This seems to be because the content
of common block UTPUT/iread,iwrit gets corrupted (it should be 11,7). 
I have added a statement : " print *,iread,iwrit" that solves the problem ....

BPz--------11/04-2007

Inserted a new routine :partfBarberH2O.f and the possibility to use H2O 
line lists from Barber et al.
Also, bsynb was modified on 28/03-2007 to print out the intensity spectrum
at mu=cos(theta)=1 when an Intensity spectrum is asked for in spherical
geometry. It is added as a 4th column in the ascii spectrum output. The 
intensity spectra at all angles are provided, as before, in a separate binary
file.
I have modified: 
Makefile
bsyn.f
eqwidt.f
partffordepth.f
bsynb.f
and added partfBarberH2O.f in source
and added energy-levels-BarberH2O.txt in DATA

BPz--------16/05-2007

Corrected HI line opacity calculation (at the ionisation edges).
There was also a real*4/real*8 conflicting declaration in the computation
of the dissolved states contributing to the continuous opacity.
A spurious spike that appeared at the ionisation edges has been (almost)
removed. I have also reduced "eps" from 0.001 to 0.0001. Eps controls
the minimum relative opacity that is accumulated.
modified routines: 
hydropac.f
babsma.f
bsyn.f
eqwidt.f
Starting from now, Turbospectrum, - consisting of babsma, bsyn and eqwidt -,
has a version number. The present version is v7.2 (i.e. year 2007 revision 2)

BPz--------17/09-2007

~implemented an automatic detection of the format of the radius variable,
i.e. RR(1:ntau), in babsma.f when reading MARCS binary files. 
This is because some older models have RR in double precision while most 
MARCS binaries have RR in single precision.
This change does not induce a version number increase.

BPz--------05/11-2007

Version 7.3:
Following updates in MARCS, implementation of consistent changes in 
turbospectrum :
1) includes new continuous opacities :
 updates of FeI, MgI, SiI, CaI,  CIA, and OH and CH continuous, extension to 
 200microns of negative molecular ions, addition of MgIff, SiIff, and MEIff 
 (all other metals). New routines for CIA, new jonabs.dat file for continuous,
 and removal of oscontmol.f routine. The jonabs.dat file is exactly the same
 as in the current MARCS version, and has all wavelengths in vacuum. They are
 shifted ot air wavelengths by the program, above 2000A.
 The changes in UV opacities are important.
2) includes updates in IRWIN_atoms.dat and IRWIN_molec.dat atomic and molecular
 data, following improvements by Vanessa Hill. They concern minor species
 (Pr, Tb, Ho, Er, Nd, Dy) for partition function and IP changes (Y, Nb, Ho,
 Hf, Ir, Th).
 NH and NH+ dissociation energy D0 are changed as well (slightly decreased)
3) H I line opacity (Hlinop.f) changed : cut of extrapolation of Allard et al.'s
 red wings of Lyman alpha at 1750A, where Doyle's H+H CIA takes over. It is
 now cut at 1750 in jonabs_vac.dat (read in detabs.f), whereas it had an extra 
 point at 1540A and was extrapolated bluewards in previous versions.
 Also, Rayleigh scattering is now cut at 1400A, which corresponds to the red cut
 of the natural damping wing of Lyman alpha in hlinop.f, that was also changed from
 1240A to 1400A.

added data files:
----------------
CIA.H-He.dat
CIA.H2-He.dat
CIA.H2-H2.Yi.dat
CIA.H2-H.dat

BPz--------10/12-2007

BPL: constants CP and C2 changed from 1.191e27 and 1.438e8 to 1.191044e27 
and 1.438769e8, as KE found a (small) impact in the calculation of
MARCS models when T was low and lambda short

Also changed eqmol_pe_lu.f, to provide correct Kp(H2+)

BPz--------08/01-2008

removed small bug, that changed  T(1) to T(k) at after each call to absko.f
in babsma.f. This T(1) was only used to print out CONTROLE. It did not affect
the results in opac files. This bug was introduced in V7.3 (commmon CA5).

Also, corrected the way the tau scale is computed in "alva" models in babsma.f

Version number stays v7.3.

BPz--------21/01-2008

1) slightly changed H I edge detection and continuum wavelength change 
 at edges in babsma.f. Due to an issue signaled by A. Chiavassa in some
 special case for an edge in the IR.
 Edge positions taken from vacuum jonabs.dat file, identical to edges 
 from hydropac.f (n=2 changed from 3647.98 to 3648.04, also in jonabs file.

2) Clight changed from 2.9979258E18 to 2.99792458E18 in function stark1
 in hlinop.f

Version number stays v7.3.

BPz--------21/01-2008

1) Improved the way PP models are detected in bsyn.f
2) added HeI scattering in detabs.f

Version number is v7.3.

The last changes are not yet distributed.

BPz--------16/04-2008

1) solved the problem with convergence of some T, Pe combinations
 that had stopped working after v7.2
 -> put back tem.le.2. instead of tem.le.2000 in die_pe_lu.f
 -> increased tolerance on abs(pe-ppe)/pe from 0.7 to 1.0 for skipprelim  
    in jon.f

BPz--------11/04-2008

1) added new anstee.f, and DATA/Anstee_newFe2_newCr2.dat
version number becomes 8.1

BPz--------06/05-2008

1) corrected bugs in calls to CIAh2h and CIAhhe, that were called
 with always the same T(1) temperature instead of T(ntp).
2) corrected loop in tranfr (formal), that could go over ntau.

BPz--------19/05-2008

V08.1 created. Compiled for intel MAC.

BPz--------19-20/05-2008

1) makeabund.f changed to allow choice of solar abundance set.
 this is exactly what is now in MARCS. the default abundance 
 set is Asplund et al. 2007
2) the H I edge spike problem has been mostly removed, by changing
 the edge wavelengths to the nearest wavelength where the spectrum
 is calculated, in hydropac.f (KE's trick). For the Balmer H I 
 edge, that I tested, there remains a small dip at one wavelength
 in the absolute continuum spectrum.
3) A number of small and
 unimportant changes where also made in bsyn.f (related to H I),
 and in bsynbplatt.f (more print-out if debug), in babsma.f, and
 inabs.f (initializing of variables) 

BPz--------11/03-2009

V09.1 created. Compiled for intel MAC.

change of FeH and CrH D00 in IRWIN_molecules.dat
inclusion of CrH in atomda (for ionisation potential)
related routines modified accordingly

modified routines:
-----------------
takemolec.f
bsyn.f
eqwidt.f
bsyn_TiOscatt.f
atomda.f
molecpartf.f

modified input data files:
-------------------------
atomdata-v09.1
IRWIN_molecules_v09.1.dat

BPz--------19/06-2009

V09.2 created. Compiled for intel MAC.

Included SiS line calculation.
Modified IP of AlH from 3.0 to 8.4 in atomdata-v09.2, and introduced SiS, and LaO.

Modified calculation for limb-darkening :
To get limb-darkening, in PP or SPH case, just ask for I, instead of F
with 'INTENSITY/FLUX:' in script.
in PP case, the ioutput spectrum contains now, just as spherical case:
lambda, F/Fc, F, I(COS(THETA))     [COS(THETA) is also provided in script.
In spherical case cos(theta) is always 1 (i.e. intensity at center of disk).
In addition a binary file is generated (file 66, called "sphlimb") that 
contains first a header :
        write(66) mcode
        write(66) rr(1),radius      ! in PP case, this is 1.,1.
        write(66) maxlam            ! number of lambdas
and then one line for each lambda:
         write(66) xlambda(j),mmu(1),fluxme,
     &                (xmu(nlx,1),y1(nlx),nlx=1,mmu(1))
lambda, number of mu-points, flux(normalised at radius in SPH case),
   mu-point,I(mu), for all computed mu's (in SPH case, these are at R(1),
i.e. at upper R (not at radius).

BPz--------05/01-2010

V10.1 created. Compiled for intel MAC.

inserted new r and s-fractions in makeabund.f, following a similar
change in MARCS2008.
Changed D00 for MgH in IRWIN_molecules_v10.1.dat  (v09.1 ->  v10.1)
and molecpartf.f accordingly in order that it uses that file.

modified routines:
------------------
makeabund.f
molecpartf.f

BPz--------02/01-2012 - 21/06-2012

This version now computes the flux so that its integral over wavelengths yields 
sigmaxTeff^4, instead of sigmaxTeff^4/pi. This is consistent with  what is done in MARCS.

atomdata : this file has been removed. The data it contained was superfluous.
A new routine has been added (getlele.f) to secure the identification of species.
Note however that it is only possible to compute spectra for a subset of molecules.
They are listed in the common block xxxx in takemolec.f.
It is now straightforward to add a new molecule for calculation of its spectrum: 
its name needs to be added in that common block. It must be spelled exactly the same
way as in the IRWIN_molecules_v12.1.dat file.

Masses of isotopomers are computed using masses of isotopes. A new data file was 
created that includes isotopic masses, fractions (not used yet, as we still rely on
the fractions stored in makeabund.f), and mass of standard laboratory mixes (not
used either, as we rely on a mass table in makeabund.f).
The data file is atomicweights.dat, and it is read by getisotopmass.f.

In this version I have added in takemolec.f:
- YO 
- TiH 
As the ionizaton energy of molecular species was provided in the atomda file, it
cannot be accessed anymore. It was used for the Unsoeld approximation of collisional
broadening. 
This recipe has been banned for molecular lines.


IRWIN_molecules_v12.1.dat :
 TiH is added. 
 the input line for CN- is modified, with a inserted space that should prevent 
 reading errors on some picky compilers.

The list of molecules to use : LISTE_molecules_all_v12.1.dat is augmented 
with TiH, and a version number is appended.

These files are declared as default files to use in input.f and in molecpartf.f

bsyn.f bsyn_TiOscatt.f and eqwidt.f have been modified to use takemolec.f
instead of an internal setup to secure the indentification of molecules.

version number updated to 12.1 in bsyn.f, babsma.f, eqwidt.f, bsyn_TiOscatt.f
NB: the version number was erroneous in v10.1 (was still v09.2)

suppressed the need for the outdata directory.

atomic species included in molecular equilibrium do not need to be defined on 
input. The default full list is given in input.f.

Hydropac.f : the Lyman series was skipped in previous versions. It is now included.
hlinop.f : a possible divide by zero was fixed. In addition 2 variables were set to 
real*8 instead of real*4. This should cure problems in the computation of Lyalpha, 
where the red wing would have a hole short of 1278A.

in depth.f, the default recipe for broadening of molecular lines is now radiative 
(+thermal and microturbulent Doppler broadening). In previous versions there was 
also a collisional broadening recipe with Gamma6 /(2c) =0.1cm-1 *sqrt(273/T) * Pg/1atm
Most of the time it would lead to negligible broadening.

a couple of tricks were added in pemake.f, babsma.f, and jon.f in order to 
improve convergence of the molecular equilibrium in some difficult cases.

A number of unimportant printouts were removed.

The directory structure is simpler : all source files are in source-v12.1/, and all
executable are in exec-v12.1/

Makefile was modified

The script file was stripped of the parts that ordinary users don't change.

version v12.2 : able to handle models with velocity fields. (v12.2 never publicly released)
********
WARNING ! These features are offered as experimental tools. There is no 
warranty that the results are of high enough scientific grade to be, e.g., 
published. In some velocity gradient conditions with inadequate choices of 
optical depth and wavelength sampling the numerical results are clearly wrong.

One paper published using this setup:
Zamora, O., Garcia-Hernandez, D.A., Plez, B., Manchado, A., 2014, A&A 564, L4
arXiv:1403.2075
Olga Zamora is thanked for extensive testing of this version.
********

Calculation of intensity at surface of model with radial velocity field, 
in spherical symmetry. The source function is assumed to be the same as computed
in the static case. The scattering part (sigma.J) is computed in the static case 
using the Feautrier method, and then added to kappa.B to approximate the source
function used in the dynamic case. 
The surface intensities are computed through a direct quadrature of the 
source function.

Models must be in the "alva" format:
e.g.:
'alva'    81 5000. 0. 0. 0.
   1100.363      3.9096874E-05  5.0000000E+13   2000000.    
   1107.004      4.0291088E-05  4.9401850E+13   2000000.    
   1113.768      4.1537001E-05  4.8803701E+13   2000000.    
   1120.656      4.2837542E-05  4.8205547E+13   2000000.    
   1127.674      4.4195800E-05  4.7607397E+13   2000000.    
....
where the first line says:
 "alva" ; number of layers ; wavelength for the standard tau-scale ; followed
by 3 scaling factors (to be set to 0).
Then one line for each layer: 
T[K] Pg[cgs] R[cm] v[cm/s]
with v the radial velocity of the layer (positive outwards, i.e. from the 
center of the star towards the observer). 
When running babsma, the parameter "HYDRODYN_DEPTH" must be set to ".true.", 
otherwise v will be taken as a microturbulence velocity.
i.e.:
../exec-v12.2/babsma_lu << EOF
'HYDRODYN_DEPTH:' '.true.'
...
EOF
When running bsyn, the same HYDRODYN_DEPTH parameter must be set to true.
The geometry must be spherical. 
It is recommended to use a tight optical depth sampling in the input model 
to diminish the velocity difference along a cell, as the calculation method 
is prone to errors (see Mihalas and Kunasz 1986, J. of Comp. Physics, 64, 1).
Use also a very high sampling rate in wavelength, to ensure that the 
interpolation of opacities, necessary because of the velocity shifts, 
be as accurate as possible.

The output spectrum file contains:
lambda; (dynamical) flux divided by (static) continuum flux; dynamic flux; 
dynamic intensity at disk center. 
Note that the normalised flux may be >1 due to the different way of calculating
the continuum (static) flux (with Feautrier's method), and the line (dynamical)
flux (with direct quadrature).

variable TLIM renamed DIFLOG to conform to common block in other routines.

Variable rhokt, and a few statements modified to accomodate doubleprecision in 
detabs.f, as in some peculiar models with very low pressure, Inf, and NaN would
be encountered. (BPz 17/08-2012) A few things were also modified in absko.f,
without any impact on calculations.

path for atomicweights.dat modified from ../DATA/ to DATA/ in getisotopmass.f

correction of a bug in pemake.f, that was introduced in version 12.1.
It would give an erroneous estimate of the pressure derivative in the first
iteration, when the electron pressure was changed due to lack of convergence.

NaH added in the common block molinpresmo in takemolec.f

modified routines:
------------------
takemolec.f

BPz--------13/04-2013

Added the possibility to include gamma_vanderWaals in line list, for atoms only. 
The value is inserted in the form log10(gamma_vanderwaals at 10000K), in place
of fdamp (the scaling factor for Unsoeld approximation). 
This gamma is only used if the routine anstee.f does not find quantum mechanical
data for the line, and adopts the Unsoeld approximation. In that case only, the 
parameter fdamp of the line list is tested. If negative, it is assumed to be 
log10(gamma_vanderWaals), and scaled to the proper temperature. A way to force
this to work for every line is to replace the level designations (e.g. 's' 'p')
by 'x' 'x'.

This modified version was used by the APOGEE team.
Carlos Allende Prieto and Olga Zamora are thanked for suggesting it, and for their
help with the implementation.

BPz--------11/03-2014 - 03/12-2014

Version 14.1 created. Intended for release with cumulative improvements since v12.1.1 (last public release)

one line commented in takemolec (obsolete output message)
Obsolete comments concerning atomdata removed from bsyn.f and babsma.f

New version : IRWIN_molecules_v14.1.dat. MnH appeared twice in previous versions.
Dissociation energy changed. 

Updated version of line broadening anstee.f and data. Only small changes and 
one Fe I line from Ruffoni et al 2014 added at 6315.8115 A
Credit: Paul Barklem.

Also added the possibility to have quantum mechanical data for collisional
broadening in line list, as it is now included in the VALD3 version of the VALD
line data base. 
We input the cross-section (at 10000 m/s) and alpha parameter (velocity exponent) 
through a packed parameter INT(sigma)+alpha.
Alternatively we use the routine anstee.f and the accompanying data (anstee.dat).
If none of this gives a result, we use the gamma_6 at 10000K parameter that may be included
in the line list. Finally if nothing works, we compute the Unsoeld approximation.

In the line list the line parameter FDAMP is used as follows:
 * fdamp < 0 is the log(FWHM) per unit perturber number density at 10000 K (rad/s cm^3) ie. log(2w/N). 
   This is the format used by VALD and Kurucz line lists, and many others.
 * 0 < fdamp < 20 gives an enhancement factor over classical van der Waals theory (Unsoeld 1955).
     (in this case, one may still find alternative data in the special anstee.f routine, and use ABO)
 * fdamp > 20 gives the ABO theory, sigma.alpha.
For example, for the Ca II H and K lines our input 
van der Waals parameter is 234.223 where sigma = 234 atomic units and alpha = 0.223 
(Barklem & O'Mara 1998). 
The program vald3line_BPz.f converts line lists from the VALD3 format to the Turbospectrum format.

Eqwidt can now be used in intensity mode in the plane-parallel version. 

Unified format for molecules and atoms in line lists.
The utility vald3lines-BPz.f allows to translate line lists from VALD3 (with atomic and molecular lines)
to the Turbospectrum format. It also includes the Barklem line broadening parameters.

Eqwidt allows now to compute eqw for molecules as well as for atoms. It can be used in the mode
"ABFIND=.false." where the output will be a copy of the line list with equivalent widths computed 
for all the lines. In the "ABFIND=.true." mode it will return an estimate of the abundance correction
for each line of the list. In that case the line list must include an eqw measurement as well as an
eqw error. By default these columns contain 0.0 and 1.0.

Molecular lines can be read either at the old or the new format. There is an automatic detection for each 
species. So the line list can be mixed. A single format for each species though.

Small changes in the output format of eqwidt, and no output when the lines are outside the wavelength
range that is asked for.

Finally, we have now an official gfortran version.
The Makefile in the exec-gf-v14.1 directory takes care of it.

version v15.1.
Simplified and unified output format for eqwidt.
Removed real*16 for molcode & molcod. This was not
compiling with gfortran on some systems.
It is now replaced by a character*20 variable. The format of the
IRWIN_molecules file had to be modified, along with all the 
routines using it.
