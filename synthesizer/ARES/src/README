2. System requirements

cfitsio	- CFITSIO - http://heasarc.nasa.gov/fitsio/fitsio.html
gcc	- GNU Compiler Collection - http://gcc.gnu.org/
gsl - GNU Scientific Library - http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
OpenMP - Open Multi-Processing library - http://openmp.org/wp/
plotutils - The plotutils Package - http://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/
or gnuplot - gnuplot library - http://www.gnuplot.info/

2.1. In this new version of ARES you can select which ploting library you want to use. The default one is gnuplot. You can change back to plotutils editing the file aresplot.h in line 13.
Instructions are commented in the code.

3. Installation

The new code was tested in different linux machines, with different linux flavours, including debian based, such as UBUNTU and Linux Mint, and other flavours such as FEDORA, CENT OS.
The code was also tested in MAC Os.

Everything should compile smoothly if you use the repository of your OS to install the required libraries. If you have installed the libraries manually, keep a note on the location of the libraries in your computer.

4. Code Compilation

With the libraries installed from the repositories:

gcc -o ARES ARES_v2.c -lcfitsio -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -lgomp -fopenmp

If you have installed one library manually, an example for the case of CFITSIO, is the folloing:

gcc -o ARES ARES_v2.c -L/usr/local/cfitsio/lib/ -I/usr/local/cfitsio/include/ -lcfitsio -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm -lgomp -fopenmp

Note: -L and -I is the location of the libraries and the include files of the cfitsio package. 

In case of having problems finding the libraries, you can add the path of the missing files (e.g. error while loading shared libraries: libgsl.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory) to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 


After the compilation is completed you can create a link into your favorite link directories (e.g. ~/bin) symbolic link directory. 

>$ln -s compiledfile ~/bin/ARES (it is better to use the full paths of both files) 

If you have the ~/bin/ in the $PATH system variable then you can run the program easily by typing: 

>$ARES 

Make sure that you have the 'mine.opt' file in the running directory.

4.1. ARES@MAC

You can check the previous installation help for MAC. I will update this section if problems are identified.


5. INPUT PARAMETERS 'mine.opt' FILE:
------------------------------------

specfits	: 1D fits spectrum for the analysis
readlinedat	: line list for the analysis
fileout	    : output file for the results
lambdai	    : initial wavelength for the search of the lines
lambdaf	    : final wavelength for the search of the lines
smoothder	: parameter for the calibration of the search of the lines. Noise smoother for the derivatives.
space	    : interval in Angstrom for the computation for each line 
rejt	    : parameter for the calibration of the continuum position.
lineresol	: this parameter sets the line resolution of the input spectra. If the code finds two lines closer than the value set for this parameters, then we take the two lines as one line alone.
miniline	: weaker line strength to be printed in the output file
plots_flag	: flag for the plots. 0-runs in batch, 1-shows the plots and stops for each line calculation.
rvmask      : parameter for the automatic RV correction



Detailed description:

To run the code it is necessary to have a file in the system running
directory named mine.opt that contains the input parameters with a 
specified format. The format of this file can be seen below. The input
parameters required to run are the following:

-specfits   : is the location of the spectra in the FITS format. 
              The header of this file must contain the CRVAL1 
              and CDELT1 keywords. The spectra should be reduced
              and calibrated in wavelength. It is supposed that 
              the spectra should have a preliminary normalization
              to avoid abnormal features in the 1D spectra such 
              the ones that can appear when using reduced echelle
              spectra.
-readlinedat: is the location of the file that contains the lines
              to be measured. The format of this file is described
              in the help file that is supplied with the code. Each
              line of this file should indicate the wavelength 
              position of each line to measure. We note that the 
              code can crash if is trying to find lines in a spectral
              region not existent in the spectrum (e.g. a spectral gap).
-fileout    : the output file. The results for the identified lines
              are prompted in this file with the following order: 
              the central line wavelength, the number of lines used 
              to fit the local spectrum, the depth of the line to 
              measure, the FWHM of the line, the EW of the line, and
              the three coefficients of the gaussian used to fit the
              line (depth, sigma, central position) respectively.
-lambdai    : initial wavelength of the interval to search the lines.
-lambdaf    : final wavelength of the interval to search the lines.
-smoothder  : value of the smooth \textit{boxcar} to use in the 
              numerical derivatives. Value 1 implies no smoothing.
-space      : wavelength interval around the line where the 
              computation will be conducted.
-rejt       : parameter required to calibrate the local continuum
              determination.
-lineresol  : minimum distance in Angstroms between lines in the spectra.
-miniline   : minimum EW value that will be prompted into the output file.
-plots_flag : If this flag is set to 1, plots of the continuum determination
              and the fit of the line will be displayed, otherwise the 
              code will run automatically without interruptions. The stop
              of the plots is available at any time passing to the auto run
              of the code, so that the user can check the measurements of
              the lines in the beginning of the line list.


New MUST KNOW features:

5.1. specfits
-------------

Here you can still provide a FITS 1D spectra, or alternatively you can provide an ASCII file. For this to work the data should be available in two distinct columns (wavelength and flux separated by spaces). Note that the wavelength still needs to be in units of Angstroms and this file should not contain any header.

5.2. rejt
---------

you can still provide a value for the rejt with values ranging from [0-1[. If you provide a value greater than one it will assume that you are providing the S/N of the spectra and will compute the rejt parameters using the relation presented in the 2015 paper.

Alternatively you can tell ARES to compute the S/N and rejt. To better explain, nothing better than a practical example. For example setting:

rejt=3;5764,5766,6047,6052,6068,6076 

This will tell ARES to evaluate the noise in three different spectral ranges, the first number (3) defines the number of ranges, and each next pair of numbers represent each wavelength region. To select these spectral regions the user should perform a careful eye inspection of the typical spectra in study, and look for spectral regions without the presence of strong lines, the ideal case will be without any lines at all. These three spectral regions given in this example are regions that have no lines, or at most very week lines, for solar-type stars, and therefore the user can take these as our recommendation.

An extra option is to have the rejt dependent on the wavelenght for this we should use the following option:

rejt=-2

Note that for this to work the file 'lambda_rejt.opt' should in the same directory. An example for this file is presented bellow.

5.3. rvmask

this is the only new parameters. If you don't provide this parameter in the input parameter file the code will not complain and will work as before assuming that the spectra is already corrected in RV.

You can tell ARES the velocity to be corrected. For example 25.5 Km/s:

rvmask='0,25.5'. 

The '0' in this option is for ARES to understand that the user is providing radial velocity to be corrected. The ARES code will read the value and will adjust the wavelength of the spectra accordingly with the Doppler shift formula:

Alternatively you can provide a mask to be used by ARES to estimate the RV. For example:

rvmask='3,6021.8,6024.06,6027.06,6024.06,20'

The first number (3) is the total of lines for the mask, the last number (20) is a kind of a ``space'' parameter to select the width for the wavelength region to compute the CCF which is then centered on the wavelength provided in the second to last position.

Examples of an line list file:'linelist.dat'

Requirements for this file:
-the first and the second lines are ignored by the code, you can use these lines to put an header.
-For the rest of the lines the code only reads the 1st column, that should be the one of the position of the lines in Angstroms
